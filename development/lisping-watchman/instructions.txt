SET
set dest val
    Sets dest to val. dest can be a registry or direct memory address.

ADDITION
add dest src
    Adds src to dest and stores the result in dest. dest and src are registries.

SUBTRACTION
sub dest src
    Subtracts src from dest and stores the result in dest. dest and src are registries.

PRINT UNTO TERMINAL
put src
    Prints the ASCII character located in/at src. src can be a registry or direct memory address.

COMPARE
cmp dest src
    Compares dest to src. Both are registries. If dest > src, z flag is set to 1. dest < src, 2. dest == src, 0.

MOVE MEMORY TO REGISTER
movm dest src
     Copies the contents of a direct memory address (src) into a register (dest)

MOVE REGISTER TO MEMORY
movr dest src
     Copies the contents of a register (src) into a direct memory address (dest).

INCREMENT
inc dest
    Increments the value in the register by 1 and stores it in the register.

DECREMENT
dec dest
    Decrements the value in the register by 1 and stores it in the register.

UNCONDITIONAL JUMP
jmp line
    Unconditionally jumps to the line in code.

JUMP IF EQUAL
je line
   Jumps to the line in code if the z flag is 0.

JUMP IF NOT EQUAL
jne line
    Jumps to the line in code if the z flag is not 0.

DEREFERENCE
drf dest src
    Dereferences the direct memory address stored within src (either a registry or a direct memory address) and stores it in dest (either a registry or direct memory address).

LOAD REFERENCE
lrf dest src
    Loads the value at/in src (a registry or direct memory address) into the direct memory address referenced to by the value at/in dest (a registry or direct memory address).

PUSH
push reg
    Pushes the contents of the register onto the direct memory address in the register s and decrements register s by 1.

POP
pop reg
    Pops the contents of the direct memory address in register s into the register reg and increments register s by 1.

MEMORY TO MEMORY
mtm dest src
    Copies the value located at src (a direct memory address) into dest (a direct memory address).

REGISTER TO REGISTER
rtr dest src
    Copies the value of register src into register dest.

NO OPERATION
nop
    0x90

DUMP REGISTERS AND FLAGS
dump
    Dumps the contents of the registers and flags to the IO. Used for debugging.

DUMP MEMORY CORE
dumpm
    Dumps the memory core to the IO. Used for debugging.
